This program is windows only.

Simply run the .bat, and the python code will run. You NEED to have python installed, and in PATH to correctly run this.

If you do not have any of the libraries needed, it will auto install them via pip.

An essential part is the Tesseact executable, from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract. This will also be auto installed and moved to the current directory. If you do not trust this, please download it through https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki, as this is the version used in my program.
